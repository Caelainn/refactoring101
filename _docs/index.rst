Overview
--------

This repo contains code samples demonstrating how to transform a
complex, linear script into a modular, easier-to-maintain package. The
code is written as a reference for the *Python: Beyond the Basics* class
at `NICAR 2014 <http://ire.org/conferences/nicar-2014/>`__, but can also
work as a stand-alone tutorial.

The tutorial uses a small, `fake set of election
results <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AhhC0IWaObRqdGFkUW1kUmp2ZlZjUjdTYV9lNFJ5RHc&output=html>`__
for demonstration purposes.

Project code evolves through four phases, each contained in a numbered
*elex* directory. Below are descriptions of each phase, along with
related questions and exercises that anticipate the next phase or set of
skills.

The goal is to demonstrate how to use Python functions, modules,
packages and classes to organize code more effectively. We also
introduce unit testing as a strategy for writing programs that you can
update with confidence. The overarching theme: ***As an application or
program grows in size, writing readable code with tests can help tame
complexity and keep you sane.***

Wondering how to use this tutorial or why the hell we called it
*refactoring101*? The
`FAQ <https://github.com/PythonJournos/refactoring101/wiki/FAQ>`__ has
answers to these and sundry other questions. Also, check out the
`Resources <https://github.com/PythonJournos/refactoring101/wiki/Resources>`__
page for wisdom from our tribal elders.
