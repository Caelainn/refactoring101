What's Next?
============

There is a much bigger world of Python language features and object-oriented 
programming that we didn't cover here. Below are just a few topics that are 
worth studying as you develop your programming skills.

-  *super* (for calling methods on parent classes)
-  Multiple inheritance and method resolution order (see the Diamond problem)
-  Decorators
-  Descriptors
-  Meta-programming and \_\_new\_\_ constructor
