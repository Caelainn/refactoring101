=========

Some resources geared for the intermediate Python programmer.

-  `Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to
   Python <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/>`__, especially the
   section on `Structuring your
   Project <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/structure/>`__
   and `Testing Your
   Code <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/tests/>`__
-  `Dive Into Python 3 <http://www.diveintopython3.net/index.html>`__ is
   a solid book for the intermediate programmer looking to deepen his or
   her skills. Especially check out the sections on `Unit
   Testing <http://www.diveintopython3.net/>`__ and
   `Refactoring <http://www.diveintopython3.net/refactoring.html>`__.
   There's also the `Python 2.x
   version <http://www.diveintopython.net/>`__.
-  `Refactoring <http://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html>`__ is a
   classic. Yes, it's printed on dead trees and code samples are in
   Java. But the collective wisdom and many of the practical techniques
   remain invaluable. It's an eye-opener.
