Why refactoring?
----------------

First, what the hell is refactoring? The technical definition is
explained nicely by
`Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring>`__. But in a
nutshell, it's a deliberate process of changing code so that it's easier
to understand and change in the future. Refactoring has a long and rich
history and can get quite technical, but we use the term loosely here.
We called this git repo/tutorial *refactoring101* because it attempts to
show how you can apply some basic principles and techniques to manage
larger programs. These skills aren't only useful for changing existing
programs. They're also a handy way of designing larger applications from
the outset.

Who is this tutorial for?
-------------------------

We assume you're already comfortable with basic programming concepts in
Python. You understand loops, conditionals, variables, and basic data
types (strings, integers, lists, dictionaries, even sets!). You've also
written a few functions in your day. But you're in that nether realm
where you get the basics, but aren't quite sure how to write larger
programs. Or perhaps like many before you (we've all been there), you've
written a monstrosity of a script that is error-prone, brittle, and hard
to decipher. You suspect there must be a better way to craft large
programs, but you're not quite sure how. If you have that itchy feeling,
this tutorial is for you.

How should I use this tutorial?
-------------------------------

It's an immersion exercise. This is not a tutorial where we walk through
the code, explaining every step. We provide an overview of the code at
each stage, and some teasers in the Questions and Exercises sections to
nudge you toward new concepts and techniques. But ultimately, it's up to
you to read the code, research language features that are new or fuzzy,
and experiment by modifying and running the scripts (and tests). That
said, you're not alone in the deep end. Hit us up on
`PythonJournos <http://groups.google.com/group/PythonJournos>`__ as you
work through the tutorial. We're friendly. We promise :)

Why did we write this?
----------------------

Because like you, we've experienced the thrill of mastering the basics
-- writing those first few scripts to get things done -- and the
inevitable frustration of not knowing what comes next. How do I write a
bigger program that does more than one thing? How do I know if some part
of the program failed? How can I use this bit of code in another script,
without having to update the code in both places? We've wrung our fists
in the air over the same questions. Hopefully this tutorial helps nudge
you toward some answers.

Who wrote this tutorial?
------------------------

`Jeremy Bowers <https://twitter.com/jeremybowers>`__ and `Serdar
Tumgoren <https://twitter.com/zstumgoren>`__, nerds from the journalism
community. Don't be shy. Hit us up with questions, pull requests, angry
criticisms, etc.

Am I alone?
-----------

That's pretty deep. But we're inclined to say
`no <http://groups.google.com/group/PythonJournos>`__.
